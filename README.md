# News Apps

A collection of simple interactive elements used in published or soon-to-be published stories and projects. 

The crime-question programs were created for a story demonstrating the disparity between perceived and actual crime types on campus. They are meant to be embedded in separate places within the story. Demos [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh2212/testing/spec/crime-question-1.html) and [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh2212/testing/spec/crime-question-2.html).

The readspeed program was created for a story about off-site library storage, meant to give readers a sense of how many books 13 million* (the number stored off site) really is. Demo [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh2212/testing/spec/readspeedtest.html). 

The book-slider is a simple graphic meant to show proportionally what Columbia University gains from collective off-site storage (ReCAP). Demo [here] (http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh2212/testing/spec/book-slider.html).

Enjoy!

*Edit: 4.76 million
