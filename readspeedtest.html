    <p> This is part of the text of a story about how many books Columbia has in an off-site storage library called ReCAP. The last sentence will say something about scale of how many books and then ask the reader to press start. </p>

    <div id="tester" style="display:none"> <p> We really wanted for people to get a sense of just how huge 13 million is when it comes to books, so I made a little game to let people know how long it would take them to read all of that. This paragraph here is meant to be just another part of the story. At the end, we ask the user to press to stop button. Now you can find out how long it would take you to read 13 million books!</p>
